# Hi there, I'm Hou 👋

Senior Full-Stack Engineer with 10+ years of full-stack engineering, now making AI actually work in production— systems with real ROI. I design, build, and deploy AI applications that deliver measurable impact from prototype to production.

## Currently Building

Working on three production AI systems with a focus on metrics, governance, and real-world deployment:

### RAG Production Platform
*Status: In Development*

Building a production-ready RAG system to handle 50K+ documents with enterprise-grade performance
- **Target**: <400ms retrieval latency with hybrid search
- **Focus**: RAGAS evaluation metrics, intelligent caching

### PromptOps Framework
*Status: Alpha*

Creating enterprise prompt management with version control and regression prevention
- **Target**: Zero regression deployments with CI/CD gates
- **Focus**: A/B testing, automated evaluation

### AI Workflow Orchestration
*Status: Architecture Phase*

Developing intelligent document processing with both LangGraph and native implementations
- **Target**: 85% automation success rate
- **Focus**: Human-in-the-loop approvals, observability

## 📊 Engineering Approach

```yaml
Philosophy: Measure everything from Day 1
Deployment: Ship at 80%, iterate based on data
Testing: Evaluation frameworks before features
Cost: Track every API call, optimize continuously
Security: PII redaction, audit trails, governance first
```

## What I'm Looking For

I'm open to conversations about:

**Cofounder/CTO Opportunities**
- Pre-seed/seed startups needing technical leadership
- Teams that value iteration and measurement
- Problems requiring production AI, not POCs

**Consulting Engagements**
- RAG implementation strategy
- Prompt governance systems
- AI cost optimization
- Architecture reviews

**Founding Engineer Roles**
- Companies ready to scale AI infrastructure
- Full ownership opportunities
- Direct product impact
