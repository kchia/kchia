# Hi there, I'm Hou 👋

Senior Full-Stack Engineer with 10+ years of full-stack engineering, now making AI actually work in production— systems with real ROI. I design, build, and deploy AI applications that deliver measurable impact from prototype to production.

## Currently Building

Working on production AI systems with a focus on metrics, governance, and real-world deployment.

## 📊 Engineering Approach

```yaml
Philosophy: Measure everything from Day 1
Deployment: Ship at 80%, iterate based on data
Testing: Evaluation frameworks before features
Cost: Track every API call, optimize continuously
Security: PII redaction, audit trails, governance first
```
