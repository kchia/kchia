# Hi there, I'm Hou üëã

I build AI systems that ship to production and scale reliably ‚Äî RAG pipelines, multi-agent workflows, and LLM applications backed by 10+ years of engineering discipline.

With experience shipping at scale for companies like Allergan Aesthetics (Abbvie), Walmart, GameStop, and Zocdoc, I bring production engineering to AI: proper evaluation, monitoring, cost optimization, and systems that don't break.
