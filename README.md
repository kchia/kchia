# Hi, I’m Hou 👋

I’m a **senior full-stack engineer** with 10+ years of experience building and operating secure, scalable, high-reliability web platforms. My background spans healthcare and large-scale consumer products, where correctness, uptime, and operational discipline mattered. I’ve been intentionally extending my full-stack skill set into AI/LLM integration through self-directed initiatives. I approach AI the same way I approach any complex dependency: with guardrails, observability, cost awareness, and clearly understood failure modes. I’m particularly interested in where AI *should* and *should not* be used in real product workflows.

## What I Work On

- **Full-Stack Applications**  
  End-to-end systems built with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Python, and FastAPI, designed to scale, be observable, and be owned long-term. Some projects use LangChain/LangGraph for orchestration.

- **AI-Powered Product Features (Exploratory)**  
  Applying LLM capabilities to specific product workflows where they add leverage, with guardrails, evaluation, and clear degradation paths. 

- **Data Retrieval & Search Patterns**  
  Structured retrieval pipelines (including vector-based approaches) used to support AI features without compromising reliability or cost.

- **Operational Scaffolding**  
  Error handling, monitoring, evaluation harnesses, and CI/CD that make complex systems — including AI-assisted ones — debuggable and supportable.

## Background

Before working on AI-enabled features, I spent over a decade as a full-stack engineer shipping code at companies including **Allergan Aesthetics (AbbVie), Zocdoc, and GameStop**. That experience shaped how I think about system design, on-call ownership, and long-term maintainability.

I founded **Kappa Innovation LLC** - a solo software development and tech training consultancy. I designed and delivered software engineering training — including AI-related curricula — for enterprise and bootcamp programs, training over 500 engineers live. Teaching reinforced my bias toward clarity, fundamentals, and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
